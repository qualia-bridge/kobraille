## ✨ Why kobraille?

In Korea, visually impaired students often cannot access
math education in Braille.
Existing tools lack accuracy, transparency, and extensibility.

kobraille is built by someone who sits at a rare intersection:

- 📖 Braille specialist — every rule grounded in KS X 1107
- 📊 Statistics & Data Science M.S. — rigorous, evidence-based approach
- 📈 Data visualization developer — clarity in how information 
     is structured and delivered

## 🚧 Status

Currently in active development (stealth mode).
